## Security Considerations for Contributors

### 🛡️ Blueprint Security Guidelines

When contributing blueprints, ensure:

1. **No Sensitive Data**: Never include API keys, passwords, or personal information
2. **Safe Code Examples**: All code examples should follow security best practices
3. **Input Validation**: Blueprint patterns should include proper input validation
4. **Secure Defaults**: Recommend secure configuration options
5. **Dependency Safety**: Only reference well-maintained, secure dependencies

### 🔍 AI Assistant Integration Security

- **Memory Isolation**: Blueprints should not access or modify sensitive system areas
- **Tool Restrictions**: Specify appropriate tool permissions for each platform
- **Data Privacy**: Blueprints should not encourage logging sensitive information
- **Sandbox Compliance**: Ensure compatibility with AI assistant security models

### 🚫 Prohibited Content

Blueprints must not contain:

- Executable code that could harm systems
- Instructions for bypassing security measures
- Patterns that encourage insecure practices
- Links to malicious resources
- Social engineering techniques

## Security Features

### 🔐 Built-in Protections

- **Schema Validation**: All blueprints are validated against security schemas
- **Content Filtering**: Automated scanning for potentially harmful content
- **Platform Sandboxing**: AI assistants run blueprints in controlled environments
- **Access Controls**: Blueprint permissions are explicitly defined

### 🔄 Regular Security Practices

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular audits of all project dependencies
- **Code Review**: All contributions undergo security-focused code review
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests run on every contribution
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked and can be audited

## Incident Response

### 🚨 In Case of a Security Incident

1. **Immediate Action**: Issue will be triaged within 24 hours
2. **Containment**: Affected components will be isolated if necessary
3. **Investigation**: Full investigation to determine scope and impact
4. **Resolution**: Fix developed, tested, and deployed
5. **Communication**: Users notified through appropriate channels
6. **Post-Mortem**: Analysis to prevent similar issues

### 📢 Security Notifications

Security updates are communicated through:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For repository watchers
- **Release Notes**: For all users
- **Discord Channel**: Real-time notifications
- **Email**: For critical vulnerabilities (if subscribed)

## Best Practices for Users

### 🔒 Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version of blueprints
2. **Review Content**: Examine blueprints before using in production
3. **Environment Isolation**: Test new blueprints in safe environments
4. **Access Control**: Limit blueprint access to trusted team members
5. **Monitor Usage**: Track which blueprints are active in your projects

### 🛠️ Platform-Specific Security

#### Claude Code

- Enable memory restrictions for large blueprint sets
- Review tool permissions before activation
- Use workspace isolation for sensitive projects

#### Cursor

- Configure file access patterns appropriately
- Review auto-completion suggestions in security-sensitive code
- Use project-specific rule sets

#### Windsurf

- Enable memory optimization to prevent information leakage
- Configure workspace boundaries
- Review collaborative features for sensitive projects

#### GitHub Copilot

- Configure suggestion filtering for sensitive repositories
- Review integration permissions
- Use enterprise features for additional security controls
