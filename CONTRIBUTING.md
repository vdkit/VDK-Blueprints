## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Before You Start

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/your-org/VDK-Blueprints/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/your-org/VDK-Blueprints/projects) for planned features
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/vibekit) to discuss your ideas

### 2. Creating New Rules

#### Use the Rule Template

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .ai/templates/rule-template.mdc .ai/rules/technologies/your-technology.mdc

# Edit the metadata and content
# See the development guide for detailed instructions
```

#### Rule Structure

Every rule must include:

```yaml
---
# === Core Identification ===
id: "unique-rule-id"
title: "Human Readable Title"
description: "Brief description of what this rule does"
version: "1.0.0"
lastUpdated: "2025-07-25"

# === Categorization ===
category: "technology"  # core|languages|technologies|stacks|tasks|assistants|tools
complexity: "medium"    # simple|medium|complex
scope: "project"        # system|project|component|file
audience: "developer"   # developer|team-lead|architect
maturity: "stable"      # experimental|beta|stable|deprecated

# === Platform Compatibility ===
platforms:
  claude-code:
    compatible: true
    memory: true
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit"]
  cursor:
    compatible: true
    globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]
    priority: "high"
  # ... other platforms

# === Dependencies & Relationships ===
requires: []            # Required rules
suggests: []            # Recommended rules
conflicts: []           # Conflicting rules
---

# Rule Content in Markdown
```

#### Rule Content Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable guidance
- **Include Examples**: Show real code patterns
- **Consider Context**: Explain when to apply the rule
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify with target AI assistants

### 3. Testing Your Changes

#### Validate Rule Schema

```bash
# Validate single rule (if validation script exists)
./scripts/validate-rule.py .ai/rules/technologies/your-rule.mdc

# Manual validation
# Check YAML frontmatter syntax
# Verify all required fields are present
# Test with AI assistants
```

#### Test with AI Assistants

1. **Claude Code**: Add rule to CLAUDE.md and test behavior
2. **Cursor**: Add to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` and verify auto-attachment behavior
3. **Windsurf**: Test memory optimization
4. **GitHub Copilot**: Verify review integration

### 4. Submitting Your Contribution

#### Commit Guidelines

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Examples
git commit -m "feat: add Vue 3 development patterns rule"
git commit -m "fix: correct TypeScript rule metadata"
git commit -m "docs: improve React integration examples"
git commit -m "refactor: optimize rule for Windsurf memory constraints"
```

## 🎯 Rule Writing Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

#### ✅ Do

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide practical, tested examples
- Include context about when to apply patterns
- Consider multiple skill levels
- Test across target platforms
- Follow established patterns in similar rules

#### ❌ Don't

- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions about user knowledge
- Conflict with existing rules without justification
- Use platform-specific syntax in universal sections
- Include deprecated patterns without migration guidance

### Metadata Best Practices

#### Platform Compatibility

```yaml
platforms:
  claude-code:
    compatible: true
    memory: true                    # Load into memory
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Write"] # Specific tools
  cursor:
    compatible: true
    globs: ["**/*.tsx"]            # Relevant file patterns
    priority: "high"               # Activation priority
```

#### Dependencies

```yaml
requires: ["typescript-modern"]     # Must have these rules
suggests: ["react19", "tailwind4"]  # Works well with these
conflicts: ["vue3"]                 # Cannot coexist
```

### Code Examples

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Clear, focused example
const UserProfile = ({ userId }: { userId: string }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);
  }, [userId]);

  return user ? <UserCard user={user} /> : <LoadingSpinner />;
};

// ❌ Avoid: Overly complex or unrealistic examples
const ComplexComponent = ({ data, config, handlers, ...props }) => {
  // 50+ lines of complex logic that doesn't clearly demonstrate the pattern
};
```
