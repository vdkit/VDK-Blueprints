# Python Packaging

## Purpose

Create distributable Python packages with proper project structure, setup.py/pyproject.toml, and publishing to PyPI. Use when packaging Python libraries, creating CLI tools, or distributing Python code.

## Core Coverage

- architecture and implementation patterns for the domain
- quality, reliability, and maintainability guardrails
- practical execution guidance for production usage

## Integration Expectations

- preserve integration contracts and existing interfaces
- surface operational constraints and validation requirements
- prioritize testability and observability in implementations

## Source Mapping

- staging source: `python-development/skills/python-packaging/SKILL.md`
- canonical id: `python-packaging`
